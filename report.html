			<p>In this report, I will be discussing about the process and the purpose of given assignment. I will be discussing about the HTML and CSS where different tags and ways I have used to create the webpage productive and also different protocols we had to consider while doing it. <br>

			Html and CSS are known to be two important core technologies developed for the development of the webpage.  Html is especially used for the base structure of the page where CSS is used for the visual representation or basic layout structure of the pages.
			<br>

			While doing this assignment we had different criteria and rules within which we had to complete our assignment. One of the most important and basic rules was plagiarism. We had to complete our tasks by not crossing the limit of the plagiarism. We could reference other works but we had to mention it in the reference. If not, we would get a failing grade. We had to stay in our own field and not use the things that are yet left to teach us. We had to use html and CSS to maximum extent so that we could show our potentiality and the knowledge we gained in the first term. Similarly, we had other criteria too. We were instructed to create our own design and layout and thus using templates or boilerplates like bootstrap, WordPress and others are not allowed. If such things were found, then it would lead to direct failure.

			<h3>May 16th</h3>
			<p>I started my work after few days we got it. I was clueless about how i would do it and how I would make my look of the website. I started with the top as most would do. I started to build my index page. I just started randomly and thought of surfing the net for some ideas. I searched and searched but couldn’t find any good ideas. I just started it and just went on. I just went on with the flow. I completed this part very soon but I had difficult time pushing it in GitHub. I had to reinstall Git bash in my computer again to make it work.</p><img src="photos/May 16.png" alt="may 16">
			<h3>May 16th - 23rd </h3>
			<p>My work started with some ideas I had gathered for my page but was still clueless and just tried many ideas. I couldn’t find out how to make my page responsive. I clearly disagree with online lectures and tutorial sessions because it makes it very difficult to use the facilities, we could have used in the college. But due to the pandemic, we are stuck at home with limited ideas and resources and it is very difficult to gain the required. These days was like add and remove for me as it can be seen in the graph I have presented below.</p><img src="photos/may 16th-23rd.png" alt="may16tomay23">
			<h3>May 23rd -30th </h3>
			<p>On this day, I just went for it. I went on for hours searching ideas surfing the internet and I got some inspiration. I love to click photos and part of me says that i want to become a professional photographer. I had the idea that I would use my photos in my website to show that my photos as well it is a good idea as well because I don’t have to search for the content i want to use in the pages. As seen in the screenshot below, I have used my own clicked picture for the background image as well in the image box also I have added my own clicked picture.</p>

			<h3>May 30th to June 5th</h3>
			<p>I started to pace up on my work. I couldn't decide what I would use for the background colors and which images would look good in the page. I was having lots of trouble making the page responsive and hamburger icon properly. I searched for proper guidance regarding it and finally started to implement it. We were only taught the introduction part of it and asked to use is to make hamburger icon with it. This made me question the curriculum provided by the university. I don't know for sure if it was because of the pandemic or what, I think we could only learn very limited content due to the communication gap that was created by the lockdown period. As the slides which was provided by the university for us were limited. I think this was the same for the others too. When I saw the assignment that was given to us for this term, I was shocked to see the contents that were present in the assignment as many contents listed in the assignment were not taught to us and was not available in the slides. Due to this reason we had to surf a lot and even asked the teacher for extra classes for the assignment</p>

			<h3>June 6th and 7th </h3>
			<p>My main focus was on the theme and the style of the nav bar with the main idea that my page reflected. I nearly completed the theme and all that was left was the content I had prepared to be added and polished. I started to check my work that I had done. I found some minor errors like few tag names which were repeated like font-family and justify-content in the CSS.</p><img src="photos/june 6th and 7th.png" alt="june 6th and 7th">
